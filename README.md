Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses YAML files to configure the application's services and then creates and starts all the containers with a single command. Here are some of the common commands in Docker Compose and their functions:

docker-compose up: This command builds, (re)creates, starts, and attaches to containers for a service as defined in the docker-compose.yml file. If the service doesn't already exist, it creates it.

docker-compose down: Stops and removes containers, networks, volumes, and other services defined in the docker-compose.yml file. It effectively shuts down the application.

docker-compose build: Builds or rebuilds services defined in the docker-compose.yml file. It can be useful when you make changes to your Dockerfile or any other build-related files.

docker-compose start: Starts existing containers for services defined in the docker-compose.yml file. It doesn't recreate them, just starts the existing ones.

docker-compose stop: Stops running containers without removing them. It's similar to shutting down a computer gracefully.

docker-compose restart: Restarts containers. It's equivalent to running docker-compose stop followed by docker-compose start.

docker-compose pause: Pauses running containers. It suspends all processes in the containers.

docker-compose unpause: Unpauses paused containers. It resumes processes in the containers.

docker-compose ps: Lists containers for a service defined in the docker-compose.yml file along with their status.

docker-compose logs: Displays log output from services. You can use it to monitor the output of containers in real-time.

docker-compose exec: Executes a command in a running container. It allows you to run commands in specific containers.

docker-compose pull: Pulls images for services defined in the docker-compose.yml file. It ensures that the images used by your services are up to date.
